I'm Shae, I'm from Chicago originally. 
I just moved from Milwaukee to Kenosha to attend DEV Code Camp. 
I am a DCA certified Diamondtologist. 
I work at Kay Jewelers currently. 
I am only working weekends while Im at DEV Code Camp. 
My favorite part of my job is doing custom designs for engagement rings. 
You start with only a center stone and you end with a piece of someone's dreams that they'll wear the rest of their lives. 


I have a cat named Fred. 
I love to hike, and kayak. 
I have a friend who is a comedian so I go to a lot of comdey clubs.
I love watching hockey and football. 
I would like to move to Arizona eventually. 
I have never been out of the country (unless you count a cruise to the bahamas).

I am really excited about how much I am learning at DEV Code Camp and hope I'll be able to keep up wih everything.
