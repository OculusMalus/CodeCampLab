Hi, my name is Damon Young. I live in Greendale with my wife and two children (ages 15 and 12). I'm originally from Logansport, Indiana, went to college at the University of Dayton and the University of San Francisco.

I recently worked for MLB.com as an Editorial Producer, writing and editing daily content. I have some coding experience, but not recently and not in C# or Python.

My goal is to use my new coding skills in an athletics/sports organization.

I enjoy running and coaching baseball. I vacationed in Myrtle Beach this summer.
