I'm Shae, I'm from Chicago originally. I just moved from Milwaukee to kenosha to attend devcodecamp. I am a DCA certified 
Diamondtologist, I work at Kay Jewelers currently. I am only working weekends while Im at devcodecamp. My favorite part of 
my job is doing custom designs for engagement rings. You start with only a center stone and you end with a piece of
someone's dreams that they'll wear the rest of their lives. 

I have a cat named Sushi. I love to hike, and kayak. I have a friend who is a comedian so I go to a lot of comdey clubs.
I love watching hockey and football. I would like to move to Arizona eventually. I have never been out of the country
(unless you count a cruise to the bahamas) 

I am really excited about how much I am learning at devcodecamp and hope I'll be able to keep up wih everything. 

Yay coding!
