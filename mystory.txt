Hey everyone, I'm Shae, I'm from Chicago originally. 

I just moved from Milwaukee to Kenosha to attend DEV Code Camp. 
I am a DCA certified Diamondtologist. 
I work at Kay Jewelers currently. 
I am only working weekends while Im at DEV Code Camp. 
My favorite part of my job is doing custom designs for engagement rings. 
You start with only a center stone and you end with a piece of someone's dreams that they'll wear the rest of their lives. 

I have a cat named Sushi.

I love to hike, and kayak.

My name is Gao Calderon.
It had taken me a long while to figure what I wanted to eventually study, which was drafting and design.
I still didn't know what to do with it or which direction of drafting did I want to go.
I was married when I finally decided I want to go back to school. 
Eventually I had to drop out for personal reasons.
When I was ready to return I was told to find a different source of finance because the school couldn't fund me for being off so long.
I decided to try Media Arts and Animation, which kept me close to the 3D world of minipulating space, material and still create things.
The field was more physically abstract than I was ready for. 
There was real compitition in that field.
But taking the challenge I went full blown on organization, planning, plotting, managing, cordinating.
I over exhasted myself with more projects than my personal life can handle.
The husband and I divorced and I had to figure out the next chapter of life.
I decided to Marry Channing Tatum instead, and now I'm the happiest I have ever been!

I dont know what I'm doing
