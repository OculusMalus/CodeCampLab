Hilary's Story

	In the spring of 2013, I graduated from the University of WI-La Crosse earning a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. 
As were many of my peers, I found myself hopelessly optimistic about my future career. I was going to work for a year in order 
to get some professional experience before going for a Master's in Research Psychology. I've been trying to save the world for 
quite some time and this was just my first step. I'd become an expert in something or another and figure out how to really help people. 
But first, I was going to work for a while and get my feet wet. As the weeks went by, I realized the job opportunities in La Crosse, WI 
weren't exactly what I was looking for and I settled in an HR Assistant position for an electronics recycling facility. 

	Long story short, I ended up getting caught up in life and the wonderfulness of the company I was working for until I woke up one day
and realized that HR was not that life for me. I could never really committ to psychology and ultimately decided that I would not be happy 
chasing grants all the time. My mom is a programmer and after years of suggestions, I finally decided to look into it. At the beginning of this 
year, I realized that problem solving is probably my biggest internal driver and that the IT world could be the right place for me. So here I
am.
